## Agenda

1. Demo: Source of Truth for Data in an App
	- Understand the difference between a non-mutable copy of a data structure instance and a mutable reference.
	- Know when to each use type of property wrapper to use to obtain a mutable reference to your data.
2. Exercise: Making a Prototype of Your App
	- Review this [completed prototype file in Keynote](https://education-static.apple.com/coding-club-kit/xcode-prototype.key).
	- Using these [iOS Design elements](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/iOS-16-Keynote.dmg), adapt the completed prototype file to instead be a prototype for your app.
3. Portfolios: Mid-module Portfolio Reviews
	- Significant areas we have addressed:
		- Brainstorm app ideas and audiences
		- How to query a database
		- How to persist data within an app
	- Meet privately with Mr. Gordon informally review your portfolio and propose a current level of achievement.
