## Agenda

1. Tutorial: [[To-do List App, Pt. 8]]
	- Add some refinements to the app, including the use of a slide-up sheet to show the user interface for adding a new to-do item.
	> [!TIP]
	> 
	> In your culminating task app, if your users need to be able to create and save data within your app, then you should complete this tutorial today.
	> 
	> Actually adding images will be covered in an optional tutorial made available in our next class.
1. Culminating Task: Create Static Interfaces
	- Making reference to your Keynote prototypes built in our prior mod, begin making static, non-interactive interfaces for your culminating task app.
		- Be sure to use [[SwiftUI Views Mastery]] as a reference while building out static interfaces.
		- Remember to use source control â€“ commit and push your work frequently.

## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Work on the items mentioned above.
	- Share your progress in one or more updates [on Notion](https://notion.so).
