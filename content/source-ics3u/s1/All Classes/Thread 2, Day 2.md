## Agenda

1. Setup: GIF Scrubber
	- Optionally, install this browser extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gif-scrubber/gbdacbnhlfdlllckelpdkgeklfjfgcmp) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gif-scrubber3/).
	- This allows you to pause, rewind, or fast-forward an animated GIF.
2. Exercise: [[Optionals]]
	- Understand how the Swift programming language handles cases where a value may not exist for a variable or constant.
3. Recap: [Develop in Swift Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/develop-in-swift-tutorials)
	- A further opportunity to consolidate concepts learned in module 1, and to learn a few new ways to write apps using the features of Xcode.
	- Chapters 1, 2, and 3 are all good choices to try this week.
