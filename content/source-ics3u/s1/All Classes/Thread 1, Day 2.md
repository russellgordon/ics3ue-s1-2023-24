## Agenda
1. Portfolio: [[Introducing Notion]]
	- Get started with using Notion.
2. Tutorial: [[Creating Bookmarks]] 
	- Please be sure you make a bookmark for your Notion portfolio page.
3. Portfolio: [[First Post]]
	- Learn more about what makes for good evidence of understanding when posting in your portfolio.
4. Install [[Xcodes]]
	- Xcodes makes it easy to manage the installation of *Xcode*, which is the programming environment we will use this year.
	  > [!NOTE]
	  > 
	  > Check your email for an invitation to join the Apple Developer program via Lakefield College School.
	  > 
	  > **Please create a new Apple ID using your LCS email address to accept the invitation.**
	  > 
	  > When creating your Apple ID, use the school's street address, but your own phone number. The complete address for LCS is:
	  > 
	  >  `4391 County Road 29`
	  >  `Lakefield College School`
	  >  `Lakefield ON K0L2H0`
	  >  `Canada`
5. Install Xcode 15
	- Use [[Xcodes]] to install Xcode 15.
	  > [!TIP]
	  > 
	  > Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
6. [[Programming with Purpose]]
	- Please watch the video and respond to the prompts provided.
## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Be sure that you have installed Xcodes and Xcode, as described above.
