## Agenda

1. Databases: Check Your Understanding
	- If you have not yet, first, please make a post [on Notion](https://notion.so) regarding your progress on the [[Databases]] task.
		- Almost every application you will write will have a database in use behind the scenes.
	- Once Mr. Gordon has your post, you can check your work against the solutions – all of which include commentary to explain how they work.
	> [!NOTE]
>
	> Please do not hesitate to ask Mr. Gordon clarifying questions when checking your solutions.
2. [[Joining Tables]]
	- What happens when we want to write a query that needs columns from multiple tables in a database?
	- Learn how to join tables, and complete the [[Joining Tables#Exercise|provided exercises]].
