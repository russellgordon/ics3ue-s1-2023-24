## Agenda
1. Concept: [[Binary Numbers]]
	- Read this mini-lesson to get a very brief introduction to how computers store numeric data.
1. Tutorial: [[Xcode Playgrounds]]
	- Please follow the steps described in this tutorial to create a playground named **Data Types and Structures**.
1. Concept: [[Data Types]]
	- Use the playground you just created to try out the examples given in this mini-lesson.
	- Take notes in your black hardcover notebook, or in your portfolio entry for today in [Notion](https://notion.so).
1. Concept: [Structures](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/structures.pdf)
	- Try out the examples described in this mini-lesson in the same playground you already have open.
1. Exercise: Model Hockey Cards Data Using Structures
	- Here is a [close-up of a retro-style hockey card for an imaginary player](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/retro-75-hockey-card-template.jpg).
	- Here is an image of [several similar cards](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/album-of-retro-75-custom-hockey-cards.jpg).
	- Write structure(s) in your playground to describe the data shown in the hockey cards.
	- Then create *instances* of your structure for at least three hockey cards. 

## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on structures as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
