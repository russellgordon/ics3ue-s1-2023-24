			- [[To-do List App, Pt. 5|Part 5]]
				- Initial set up of the cloud-hosted database.
				- Starting to learn about the MVVM design pattern.

				- Authoring the view model to communicate with the database.
			- [[To-do List App, Pt. 7|Part 7]]

				- Enabling row-level security.
	- If you are finished those tutorials, making reference to your Keynote prototypes built in our prior mod, begin making static, non-interactive interfaces for your culminating task app.
