## Agenda

1. Concept: [[Structures vs. Classes]]
	- Take your time reading through this lesson.
	- Make notes regarding your observations.
	- Then draw conclusions when prompted to understand how classes are handled differently from structures in the Swift programming language.
	- You are welcome to work through the playground and discuss ideas with a partner, but you *please make your own notes* â€“ the process of thinking about what you are seeing, and then considering how to explain that in writing, is a big part of building your long-term memories.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> 
	> Share your notes in a portfolio post on Notion; Mr. Gordon will provide feedback.
	
1. Tutorial: [[To-do List App]]
