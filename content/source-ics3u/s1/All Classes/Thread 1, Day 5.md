## Agenda
1. Exercise: Modelling a Report Card
	- Create a [[Xcode Playgrounds|new Xcode playground]] named **Report Card Exercise**.
	- Work with your partner to author a structure that could efficiently store the data shown [[Report Card Example|in this report card]].
	- Remember: **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself
		- Use [strategies we have discussed](https://gist.github.com/russellgordon/a9be1f533e43085c184428bce46d947b) to avoid repeatedly defining similar fields.
1. Setup: Obtain Digital Copies of Your Books
	- Follow the instructions given in class to obtain your digital copies of *SwiftUI Views Mastery* and *Working with Data in SwiftUI*.
1. Concept: [[Layout]]
	- Learn how to create basic page layouts in SwiftUI.
	- Please continue to use screenshots to show the *results* of code being run.
1. Exercise: Create a Wireframe Layout
	- Select at least two layouts [from these examples](https://russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/wireframes.pdf).
	- Use the same concepts we have just looked at to wireframe the layouts you selected.

## Things to do before our next class
- [ ] Complete the exercise on layout as described above, then write about what you learned in a portfolio entry on [Notion](https://notion.so).
