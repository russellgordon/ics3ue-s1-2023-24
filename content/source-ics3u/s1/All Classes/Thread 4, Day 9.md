## Agenda

1. Culminating Task: Working Period
	- Use this period to continue building your culminating task app.
	- An exemplar app is being built by Mr. Gordon to help interested students review key concepts.
		- You may wish to download and try out the [Keynote prototype for the app](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2023-24/ics3u/App_Prototype_Exemplar.zip) being built – a reading journal app.
		- [This video explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ltYV72fKM) how about half of this app's interface is built.
		> [!TIP]
		> 
		> You are not required to watch this video end-to-end (or at all) but are more likely to, instead, choose to consult only certain chapters.
		> 
		> For example, if your app includes an opening screen with a "Get Started" link you may wish to [watch this chapter of the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ltYV72fKM&t=368s).
		- If you are ready to start querying a database table joined to another database table – with either a one-to-many or a many-to-many relationship – review [this example provided by the Supabase documentation team](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/joins-and-nesting?queryGroups=language&language=swift). Supabase automatically detects joined tables and makes writing queries against them much easier than they otherwise would be.
		> [!TIP]
		> 
		> A more complete example of how to query joined tables is coming by tomorrow from Mr. Gordon.
