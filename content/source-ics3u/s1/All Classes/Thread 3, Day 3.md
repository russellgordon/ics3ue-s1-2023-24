## Agenda

1. Exercise: App Design Journal
	- If you have not yet, finish the Brainstorm (green) section.
1. Concept: [[Databases]]
	- How can information be organized within an app, beyond a simple [[Lists|list]]?
	- Almost every application you use has a database behind it.
	- Read on to learn what a database is and how to query it (obtain information) from it.
	> [!NOTE]
	> 
	> If you have finished the App Design Journal, start on, or continue with, this activity.
	> 
	> When you are finished (or have gotten as far as you can) share your progress [on Notion](https://notion.so). Once you have done so, Mr. Gordon will send you a link to the solutions, and you can check your work.

## Things to do before the end of class
- [ ] Be sure item 1 is completed, and hopefully at least get a start on item 2.
