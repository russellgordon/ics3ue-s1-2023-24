## Agenda

1. Culminating Task: Create Static Interfaces
	- Make a big push to score significant progress on your static interface today.
		- Use your Keynote prototypes as a reference.
		- Be sure to use [[SwiftUI Views Mastery]] as a reference while building out static interfaces.
		- Remember to use source control â€“ commit and push your work frequently.
		> [!TIP]
		> 
		> After your static interface is complete, the next step is to create and populate your database. A how-to guide on this topic is forthcoming.
		> 
		> Note that this step is necessary for completion of culminating tasks but database design and creation is *not* being evaluated.
		> 
		> If you are ready now, see Mr. Gordon today in class, and he will give you the condensed version of the database design and creation lesson on the spot.
