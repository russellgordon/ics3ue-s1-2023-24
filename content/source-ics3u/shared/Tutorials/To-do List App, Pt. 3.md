In [[To-do List App, Pt. 2|part two]] of this task, you improved the to-do list app so that it became interactive.

However, the app has two obvious flaws at present:

1. The text of a to-do item cannot be modified.
1. When the app is force-quit and re-opened, any to-do items that were created are lost.

Today you will learn how to correct these issues.

## Allowing a to-do item to be modified

At present, your to-do list app should have this functionality:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_05.45.56.gif|300]]

You can add a to-do item, delete a to-do item, and mark an item as complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> If your to-do list app cannot do these things yet, please return to [[To-do List App, Pt. 2|part 2 of this tutorial series]].

Try running your app again. Notice that if you tap anywhere on a row for a to-do item, the completion status is toggled:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_05.50.32.gif|300]]

This is a bit of a problem.

What if we wanted the user to be able to modify, or edit, the text of a to-do item?

Where would they click?

How could we tell if they were trying to toggle the completion status of a to-do item, as compared to clicking the text to change it?

### Toggling a to-do item by tapping just the image

The reason a to-do item is toggled by tapping anywhere on a given to-do item is because the `.onTapGesture` view modifier is attached to the entire `ItemView` helper view.

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 5.53.12 AM.png]]

To be able to toggle an item by tapping *only* on the circle image, we need to move that view modifier inside the `ItemView` helper.

So, first, highlight the code shown here in `LandingView`, and *cut* it into your clipboard using **Command-X**:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.00.20 AM.png]]

Now switch to `ItemView`:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.00.50 AM.png]]

Paste the code right below the `Image` structure that is serving as the icon for the `Label`:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.02.07 AM.png]]

This creates a few problems we need to fix.

First, within the `ItemView` structure, a given to-do item has the name `currentItem` instead of `todo`.

So, on line 22, change:

```swift
todo.done.toggle()
```

...to:

```swift
currentItem.done.toggle()
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.03.58 AM.png]]

A new problem presents itself.

The stored property named `currentItem`, representing a single to-do item, is passed to `ItemView` as a *constant*.

That means we cannot change anything related to the to-do item.

To fix this, we must make another edit, this time on line 12.

Change:

```swift
let currentItem: TodoItem
```

...to:

```swift
@Binding var currentItem: TodoItem
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.06.35 AM.png]]

The `var` keyword means `currentItem` will be a *variable*, so we can change values stored within that instance of the `TodoItem` type.

The `@Binding` property wrapper means that the `currentItem` stored property is *bound* to the *source of truth* (the original source of the data) back on `LandingView` – recall that we iterate over the array of to-do items using the `List` structure, and create bindings to each to-do item:

```swift
List($todos) { $todo in
```

Finally, since we have now declared `currentItem` as a `var` using the `@Binding` property wrapper, we have changed the type of information we are asking to be provided by any code that creates instances of `ItemView`:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.13.32 AM.png]]

So... a couple more edits are required.

Scroll down in `ItemView` to the `#Preview` section and adjust the code as follows – old code is in grey, new code is in blue:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.14.35 AM.png]]

By passing in, for example, `Binding.constant(firstItem)` rather than just `firstItem`, we are creating the expected argument type – remember, by using this code on the stored property:

```swift
@Binding var currentItem: TodoItem
```

... we indicated that we want `currentItem` to be *bound* (connected to) some source of truth.

For the previews section of our code, using `Binding.constant` essentially creates a temporary source of truth that cannot be changed (this is good enough for seeing a preview of `ItemView`).

What we *really* need to do, though, so that data within `currentItem` can be changed within the helper view, is make one final tiny edit in `LandingView`, at the call site for `ItemView`.

Return to that file now, and find this line of code:

```swift
ItemView(currentItem: todo)
```

It will probably be around line 31:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.18.08 AM.png]]

Simply add a `$` in front of `todo`, like this:

```swift
ItemView(currentItem: $todo)
```

By doing so, as shown here:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.23.31 AM.png]]

... we provide the expected type (a binding) which means that, when the completion status of an item is changed inside `ItemView`, that change – through the binding – is passed back up to the source of truth, here, in `LandingView`.

Try out your app now – notice that the completion status only changes when you tap on the circle image for a to-do item:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_06.25.08.gif|300]]

This is important progress that we don't want to lose – or mix in with other changes we are about to make – so please, commit and push your work now with this message:

```
Using @Binding in helper view to allow the image only to be tapped to change to-do item completion status.
```

### Modifying a to-do item by tapping the text

The next change is much smaller, as we've already done most of the required work in the most recent section of this tutorial.

We want to be able to tap the text of a to-do item, then simply type to change it.

So, inside `ItemView`, we will make the following edit – change the code (around line 17) from this:

```swift
Text(currentItem.title)
```

... to this instead:

```swift
TextField("Enter a to-do item", text: $currentItem.title, axis: .vertical)
```

... like this – old code is in grey, new code is in blue:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.33.58 AM.png]]

A `Text` structure is read-only – it just presents information.

A `TextField` structure both presents data, and allows it to be changed.

This text field (if it were empty) will prompt the user with the text "Enter a to-do item".

It is bound to `$currentItem.title` so that whatever the user types is placed inside the `title` property of `currentItem`, which is of course an instance of our `TodoItem` data type.

Finally, the parameter `axis` and argument `.vertical` means that if the user types a to-do item that is longer than the space available on a single line, the text field will expand to take up a second line (or more), as needed.

Try this out:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_06.36.22.gif|300]]

Editing to-do items is a necessary feature, because human beings make typos.

For example:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_06.38.21.gif|300]]

Although only one line of code was changed, it is an important modification, and we don't want to mix up this edit with the source code edits we are about to make.

So, please commit and push your work with this message:

```
Made to-do items editable and responsive to size of the text they contain.
```

## Persist data with SwiftData

Next, we will adjust the app so that when it is quit, and then re-opened, data is *persisted*, or saved.

For most of this year, we have been creating interactive apps using the **SwiftUI** framework, which is a library of code authored by a team at Apple.

Today, you will learn how to make use of another framework – **SwiftData** – which makes it easy to persist data in a database.

### When to use it

Use SwiftData to persist data within your app *when a given user of your app is the only person who ever needs to see that data*.

Here are a few examples of good use cases for SwiftData:

- a journalling app where a person might record their daily thoughts
- an expense tracker
- a note-taking app

These are just a few ideas.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> SwiftData *does* support syncing data between multiple devices owned by a single individual, by using iCloud. 
> 
> Setting up syncing between devices goes beyond the scope of this tutorial, however.

### Theory

> [!NOTE]
> 
> You will never to be quizzed or tested on terminology and concepts related to the SwiftData framework.
> 
> However, it's useful to have a general grasp of what is going on when you make use of a given framework.
> 
> So, read on to understand how the SwiftData framework automatically creates a database on our behalf to persist information kept within our apps.

There are four main components that are always used when working with SwiftData in SwiftUI.

Borrowing from [Mark Moeyken's very recently published book on this topic](https://www.bigmountainstudio.com/swiftdata), those four components are:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 6.49.10 PM.png]]

You are already familiar with a *model* and a *view*.

The role of those parts of an app do not change.

A *container* takes care of storing the data so it persists on a device. SwiftData is backed by a SQLite database. Behind the scenes, a SwiftData container reads and writes information to that database.

The *context* sits between the container and our app. It fetches data, and allows us to insert, change, and delete data. A SwiftData context even has built-in support for undo/redo actions.

Let's look at each of these four components just a bit more closely.

#### The model

The model of an app is the *definition* of all the information that it can store – how it will be structured and organized.

For example:

```swift
class Dog {
	let name: String
	let massInKG: Double
}
```

A data model is not the same thing as a data object.

An *object* is an instance of a model that is actually populated with real data.

For example:

```swift
let myDog = Dog(name: "Piper", massInKG: 31.2)
```

#### The container

A SQLite database provides an organized way for storing and retrieving information.

The SwiftData framework is an abstraction that keeps the messy details of how this works hidden, so we can focus on the unique logic of making our apps, without having to do more tedious work – like manually defining database tables or writing raw SQL queries that join tables together.

When you hear the word *persist* that means *keep data around* – even when power to a device is lost. An iPhone uses a solid state drive or SSD to persist data.

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.03.56 PM.png]]

#### The context

This is a place in memory to work with data while your app is running.

An SSD is fast, but memory – random access memory or RAM – is much, much faster:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.13.14 PM.png|350]]

As indicated before, the context takes care of fetching, changing, deleting, and adding new data.

All of this happens in memory, and usually, we let SwiftData decide when to write that data to the container and on to permanent storage. SwiftData ensures that if your app is quit or backgrounded, your data will be persisted.

#### The view

As you know, the view is what we see in an app, and how we interact with data.

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_06.50.50.png|325]]

At a very literal level, app design is all about identifying a way to uniquely present data to users – and allowing them to interact with that data easily.

If the convenience and utility of using your app to interact with data outweighs the price you attach when you choose to sell software – well, *that* is how you make money as an app developer. 💵

#### Putting it all together

To remind us that the *container* and *context* draw their information from the *model*, Apple has designed the SwiftData framework so that the word *model* is always present.

The four main parts of SwiftData are formally named:

1. Model
2. ModelContainer
3. ModelContext
4. The View

Here is a summary:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.31.30 PM.png]]

Here is a somewhat simplified look at what happens when an app using SwiftData is opened:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.24.09 PM.png]]

When it's time to save data, here is what happens:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.35.23 PM.png]]

I agree with Mark Moeykens, who states his belief that the *ModelContainer* is the most important part of SwiftData.

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 7.29.00 PM.png]]

### Application

Now let's apply everything you just learned about.

I think you'll be pleasantly surprised to see how *few* code changes are required.

#### Adjust the model

Navigate to the `TodoItem` structure in the `Model` group:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.50.25 AM.png]]

Where we are currently importing just the low-level `Foundation` framework (a minimal collection of code provided by Apple) we will now instead import the `SwiftData` framework:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.53.51 AM.png]]

SwiftData works with classes, rather than structures. Among other reasons, this allows data for a given instance of a datatype to be shared among multiple screens within an app – since a pointer to a single source of data is created – rather than a copy.

Accordingly, change line 10, so that a class is defined instead of a structure:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.55.39 AM.png]]

Don't worry about the errors that are created. Those will be cleaned up in a moment.

To mark `TodoItem` as a data type that we want to use as a *model* with SwiftData, add the code `@Model` on the line above the class definition:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.57.09 AM.png]]

One of the nice things about SwiftData is that is automatically makes data types used with it conform to the `Identifiable` protocol. 

So, we can remove the `id` stored property entirely, as SwiftData will create this behind the scenes on our behalf:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 6.58.20 AM.png]]

Finally, you can see that the Swift compiler really, really wants us to create an initializer for our `TodoItem` class.

So, place your cursor just after the `done` property, press **Return** a few times, and then start typing `init`.

Auto-complete should do the rest of the work for you, creating a basic initializer, which is all we need:

![[Adding an initializer 1.gif]]

Ultimately, your code should look like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.01.50 AM.png]]

We are not done adding SwiftData support to the app, but this is a good time to commit your work.

Please do so now with this message:

```
Adjusted model for a to-do item to use the SwiftData framework.
```

That's step 1 complete – adjusting the model.

#### Add the container

Next we set up the container.

Navigate to the app entry point file – `TodoListApp`.

Import the SwiftData framework, then create a container for the `TodoItem` model by adding the code shown on line 16:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.05.14 AM.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> Be prepared to see error messages often if you forget to add the SwiftData framework at first. It happens to Mr. Gordon frequently! 😅

Quoting from [Mark Moeyken's book again](https://www.bigmountainstudio.com/swiftdata) – here is what that `.modelContainer` view modifier is telling SwiftData to do:

1. Create our permanent storage – the database file itself – if it is not already there.
2. Create this model (`TodoItem`) in our permanent storage – this will be a database table – it is created if not already present.
3. Load the model into the model context (more on this later).
4. Add the model context to the environment of the view (or window group) it is attached to.

This is another important step, so please commit and push your work with this message:

```
Added model container to the app entry point.
```

#### Disable previews temporarily

Handling previews (the side panel where a single view within an app can be seen) requires a bit of extra work with SwiftData.

For now, we will comment out the code that shows previews.

Navigate to `LandingView` and comment out that code:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.08.30 AM.png]]

Then do the same for `ItemView`:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.09.12 AM.png]]

We don't want to mix these changes up with the changes we're about to make, so please commit and push these changes now:

```
Temporarily commented out Xcode Previews while adding SwiftData support to our app.
```

#### Add the context

We need the context to do **CRUD** – create, read, update, or delete data.

Any view that needs to perform those operations needs access to the context.

We access the context through the *environment* of our app:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-18 at 8.03.11 PM.png|300]]

What is this mysterious environment, though?

The environment is a small, special section of variables and constants managed by SwiftUI that make it easy to share information between views.

In this case, a moment ago we created the container at the app entry point, and it will handle these four steps, as described earlier:

1. Create our permanent storage – the database file itself – if it is not already there.
2. Create this model (`TodoItem`) in our permanent storage – this will be a database table – it is created if not already present.
3. Load the model into the model context (more on this later).
4. Add the model context to the environment of the view (or window group) it is attached to.

Step 3 was to create the context – which we now need – so here is how to get at it from `LandingView`.

First, remember to import the SwiftData framework:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.42.08 AM.png]]

Then, in the stored properties section, create a new property named `modelContext`, like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.43.00 AM.png]]

To keep these changes separated from the next step, please commit and push your work now, with this message:

```
Added the model context to the landing view so we are ready to perform creations, deletions, modifications, etc.
```

#### Adjust view to run a query

On line 25 we currently create the *source of truth* – the single place where our list of to-do items exists:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.44.27 AM.png]]

We are now going to change that, so that instead, the to-do items are stored in the database that is managed by SwiftData.

Replace that code on line 25 with this instead:

```swift
@Query var todos: [TodoItem]
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.45.53 AM.png]]

That tells SwiftData to run a query that is equivalent to the following:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM TodoItem
```

So, imagine that we'd created a database file ourselves.

We then created a database table named `TodoItem`.

The code:

```swift
@Query var todos: [TodoItem]
```

... essentially runs the `SELECT` query and places all the to-do items found into the `todos` array.

Next, we need to change how the `List` structure iterates over that array.

SwiftData automatically creates references to each to-do item when a `List` iterates over an array that is populated by SwiftData.

We do not need to manually create these bindings.

So, we can change to code on line 33 from this:

```swift
List($todos) { $todo in
```

... back to this:

```swift
List(todos) { todo in
```

... as shown:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.49.45 AM.png]]

Next, we must adjust line 35, to simply use the `todo` reference, instead of the `$todo` binding:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.51.46 AM.png]]

You can see that we have an error, as `ItemView` is expecting us to provide an argument that is a regular binding, like we had before.

So, navigate to `ItemView`, and change this line of code on line 12 from this:

```swift
@Binding var currentItem: TodoItem
```

... to this:

```swift
@Bindable var currentItem: TodoItem
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.54.00 AM.png]]

So, what is the difference between `@Binding` and `@Bindable`?

When you are storing information in-memory only, and the source of truth for the data on a parent view was marked with `@State`, as our `todos` array used to be:

```swift
@State var todos: [TodoItem] = exampleItems
```

... use `@Binding` to connect to the source of truth from a child, or helper, view.

When you are storing information using SwiftData, and the source of truth for the data comes from a query on a parent view:

```swift
@Query var todos: [TodoItem]
```

... use `@Bindable` to connect to the source of truth from a child, or helper, view.

We are almost done.

Recall that we need to use the model context to perform **CRUD** operations – create, read, update, or delete data.

Navigate back to `LandingView`, and scroll down to the `createToDo` function:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 7.58.40 AM.png]]

We will fix line 78 by changing the code from:

```swift
// Append to the array
todos.append(todo)
```

... to:

```swift
// Use the model context to insert the new to-do
modelContext.insert(todo)
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 8.00.25 AM.png]]

When using SwiftData, the model context **must handle all operations that change data**. We **cannot** manipulate the contents of the `todos` array directly.

Next, we must change the function that handles deletions.

Again, we cannot directly manipulate the contents of the `todos` array. We will instead have the model context handle this for us.

Change the entire function from this:

```swift
func delete(_ todo: TodoItem) {
	
	// Remove the provided to-do item from the array
	todos.removeAll { currentItem in
		currentItem.id == todo.id
	}
	
}
```

To this:

```swift
func removeRows(at offsets: IndexSet) {
	
	// Accept the offset within the list
	// (the position of the item being deleted)
	//
	// Then ask the model context to delete this
	// for us, from the 'todos' array
	for offset in offsets {
		modelContext.delete(todos[offset])
	}
}
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 8.03.59 AM.png]]

Finally, we need to make an adjustment to the call site for deleting an item.

Rather than manually create a swipe action:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 8.07.16 AM.png]]

... we must instead use a view modifier specifically designed to handle deletions when using SwiftData.

So, change this code:

```swift
List(todos) { todo in
	
	ItemView(currentItem: todo)
		// Delete a to-do item
		.swipeActions {
			Button(
				"Delete",
				role: .destructive,
				action: {
					delete(todo)
				}
			)
		}

}
.searchable(text: $searchText)
```

... to this:

```swift
List {
	ForEach(todos) { todo in
		
		ItemView(currentItem: todo)

	}
	.onDelete(perform: removeRows)
}
.searchable(text: $searchText)
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 8.09.11 AM.png]]

The resulting code is a little cleaner.

Note that we have switched to using a `ForEach` structure to iterate over the `todos` array. This is required because `.onDelete` does not work on a `List` structure.

Note that the `.searchable` view modifier remains attached to the `List`.

At this point, we have made the adjustments necessary for SwiftData to do it's job for us, by completing these four steps mentioned earlier:

1. Adjusted the model
2. Created the container
3. Added the context
4. Made the view use the context to handle **CRUD** operations

To test this code out, you will need to run the code in the full Simulator app.

If you force quit the app in the Simulator, notice how the to-do items are still there when you open the app again:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_6.1_2024-04-09_08.12.40.gif|300]]

This is clearly huge progress, so please commit and push your work with this message:

```
Adjusted the view to work with the model context instead of an in-memory array.
```

## Inspecting the database file

As explained above, behind the scenes, SwiftData uses a SQLite database to persist data.

You have had [[Databases|plenty]] [[Joining Tables|of]] [[Queries Consolidation|experience]] querying a database by now.

Let's open the database file created by SwiftData within your app so you can poke around inside it.

Navigate to the `Helpers` group in your app, and add a file named `Functions.swift`.

Then, copy and paste this function into the file:

```swift
func printCommandToOpenDatabaseFile() {
    let urls = FileManager.default.urls(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask)
    let documentsDirectory = urls[0].absoluteString.trimmingPrefix("file://").replacing("%20", with: " ")
    let command = "open \"\(documentsDirectory)default.store\" -a \"/Applications/DB Browser for SQLite.app\""
    print(command)
}
```

...like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.39.14 AM.png]]

Next, navigate to the `Views` group, open `LandingView`, and fold up the `VStack` using code folding.

Add the `.onAppear` view modifier, with the following code:

```swift
.onAppear {
	printCommandToOpenDatabaseFile()
}
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.41.36 AM.png]]

That code will cause the `printCommandToOpenDatabaseFile` function to run when the `LandingView` screen appears.

Now run the app in the full simulator, using **Command-R**.

When the app runs, a command that will let you access the database file will be placed in the debug console in Xcode:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.45.38 AM 1.png]]

Highlight, then copy that command into your computer's clipboard using **Command-C**.

Then, use Spotlight on your Mac to search for and open the **Terminal** app:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.47.30 AM.png]]

Once Terminal opens, paste the entire command on the command prompt, and press the **Return** key:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.49.46 AM.png]]

After you press the **Return** key, you should hopefully see the database created by SwiftData opened in the **DB Browser** app:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.50.55 AM.png]]

Finally, you can browse the data in the `ZTODOITEM` table, which corresponds to the `TodoItem` structure that we created for our model:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-09 at 11.51.57 AM 1.png]]

Any to-do items you have entered within your app should be present in the database table shown.

Normally there is no reason to poke around in the database file that SwiftData creates.

Definitely don't manually change any of the data shown there, as that will likely confuse the SwiftData framework the next time you run your app.

However, it's useful to see that behind the scenes, SwiftData creates this database file – and to realize that it is nothing that you are not already familiar with.

Commit and push this final code change with the following message:

```
Added a command to show the location of the database created by the SwiftData framework.
```

## Discussion and Exercise

In the next part of this tutorial, for our next class, you will learn how to re-enable Xcode Previews when using SwiftData.

For now, when using the app, notice how the text of a to-do item remains after a to-do item is added:

Look at the code in the `createToDo` function and consider the stored properties that are defined for `LandingView`.

How could you add a single line of code to ensure that the text field, when adding a to-do item, is emptied after a to-do item has been added?
