## Introduction

Over the next few classes, you will build a to-do list app, and by doing so, learn how to use both a local database and a cloud-hosted database to persist data (keep data permanently) within an app.

Let's get started!

## Build the static interface

Once you are satisfied with a prototype for an app, a great first step when beginning to author code is to create a *static interface*.

That means you create a user interface that looks like a functioning app, but holds information that cannot change.

The app appears to be complete but is not yet interactive.

Once you have built a static interface, you can then add logic to make the app come to life.

So, the first step in creating your to-do list app will be to create the static interface.

Using what you remember from the first two threads of this course, work alone or with a partner to reproduce this user interface:

As a hint, here is *part* of the code needed to get started:

And remember... **D.R.Y.!**
