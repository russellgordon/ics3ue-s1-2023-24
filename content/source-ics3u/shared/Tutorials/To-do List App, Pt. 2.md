In [[To-do List App|part one]] of this task, you worked to activate prior knowledge by building a static interface for the To-do List app.

## Creating the static interface

There was a lot to remember for creating a static interface, and a long March Break probably did not help!

If there was any part of creating the static interface that you could not remember how to do, use the following video to get ready for part 2 of this tutorial.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suSEW0qB9F4" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen="" title="Changing the Name of an App"></iframe>
</div>

If you [watch the video directly on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suSEW0qB9F4), and click the **more** link, you can access the chapter markers for this video.

You should see the following:

Using chapter markers is recommended if you only need to review part of the process of creating a static interface.

## Review the project

At present (after using the video above, or making adjustments to your prior work to match) you should have a project with three groups:

- `Helpers`
- `Model`
- `Views`

There should be a model to represent a single to-do item, or reminder.

Here, that has been named `TodoItem`:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.44.51 AM.png]]

A helper view named `ItemView` should exist. It's job is to show the user interface for a single to-do item:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.45.10 AM.png]]

Finally, a view named `LandingView` exists – it is the view that the app entry point "lands on", hence, it's name.

This view presents the main user interface of the to-do list app:

## Creating a dynamic scrollable list

The scrollable list in the app is currently composed of three to-do items that never change:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.46.57 AM.png]]

The first thing we need to do is add an *array* (also called a list) to hold each to-do item.

Make the following edit to add that stored property:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.52.30 AM.png]]

The name of the array that will holds our list of to-do items is `todos`. The array holds instances of the data type `TodoItem`. We initially populate the list with the `exampleItems` array found in the `TodoItem.swift` file.

Next, we need to make the `List` structure iterate over this new array, to show it's contents.

Make the following changes:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.53.35 AM.png]]

Now, on line 29, the `List` iterates over the array named `todos`. As that happens, each individual to-do item is placed in a temporary constant named `todo`.

On line 31, instead of showing specific pre-written to-do items, instances of `ItemView` are created to show whatever values exist in the `todos` array.

Here are the same changes again, showing old code above in grey, with new code below in blue:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.57.31 AM.png]]

There are no visible changes to the user interface, but we have made the list dynamic.

This sets us up to be able to add new to-do items to the array – but first – please commit and push your work with this message:

```
Made the scrollable list iterate over an array.
```

## Adding new to-do items

Next we will make it possible to add to-do items.

### Define the function

First, use code-folding to fold up the `body` property:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.59.08 AM.png]]

Now add the following code below the `body` property but *before* the closing `}`  of the `LandingView` structure:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 9.59.54 AM.png]]

We have created a function named `createToDo`. It has one parameter, whose external name is `withTitle`. The argument passed in to that parameter can be accessed inside the function by the internal name of `title`. The datatype of the parameter is `String`.

Inside the function, we create a new instance of the `TodoItem` data type (lines 56 to 59).

Finally, we add the new to-do item to the end of the array (line 62).

### Invoke the function

We have defined the function above, but not invoked it.

To invoke, or use the function, expand the `body` property and add this code to the `Button` structure:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.02.56 AM.png]]

On line 41, we invoke the function, creating a to-do item using whatever was typed into the text field.

Try this out.

### Avoid blank to-do items

You may notice it is possible to add a to-do item that has no text. 

We can disable the **ADD** button when no text has been entered.

Add the following code:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.04.29 AM.png]]

On line 44, the `disabled` view modifier greys out – disables – itself until the `newItemDescription` stored property (which the text field on line 37 is bound to) is no longer empty.

Once something is typed in the text field, the button is enabled. This ensures that blank items are not added to the list.

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Made it possible to add a new to-do item.
```

## Deleting to-do items

Sometimes we might create to-do items by mistake. The user should be able to delete items in this situation.

### Define the function

Use code-folding to fold up the `body` property and the `createToDo` function:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.08.39 AM.png]]

After the `createToDo` function, but before the closing `}` of the `LandingView` structure, add the following function:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.09.08 AM.png]]

We have created a function named `delete`. It has one parameter that has no external name – this is indicated with an `_` (underscore) character. The argument passed in to that parameter can be accessed inside the function by the internal name of `todo`. The datatype of the parameter is `TodoItem`.

Inside the function, we remove all to-do items from the `todos` array that have an `id` matching the `id` of the to-do item that was passed to the function.

We have defined the function, but we are not using it yet.

### Invoke the function

Expand the `body` property and add the code shown immediately below the `ItemView` structure:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.12.31 AM.png]]

When the user swipes from right-to-left on a to-do item, a red **Delete** button will now appear.

If the user taps that button, the `delete` function is invoked. We pass the function an argument of `todo`, which represents the current to-do item in the list. 

Recall that in this line of code:

```swift
List(todos) { todo in
```

... we told the scrollable list to iterate over the array named `todos` and place each to-do item in turn in the temporary constant named `todo`. It is that constant that is passed to the `delete` function. When the button is pressed, the `delete` function is invoked.

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Made it possible to delete a to-do item.
```

## Mark an item as complete (or not)

The to-do list app is not very useful if we cannot change the status of a to-do item.

Add the code shown below on lines 42 to 45 to your project:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.25.31 AM.png]]

You will immediately see this error message:

> "Cannot use mutating member on immutable value: 'todo' is a 'let' constant"

This is because of the code we have on line 29 in our app, shown here again for reference:

```swift
List(todos) { todo in
```

We have told the scrollable `List` structure to iterate over the `todos` array, but with the current syntax, `todo` is created as a constant. We can *display* the data it contains, but we cannot change it.

To fix this, change the code to the following:

```swift
List($todos) { $todo in
```

Like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-04-08 at 10.28.58 AM.png]]

What happens now is that the `List` structure iterates over the `todos` array just like it did before. However, instead of creating constants, it creates **bindings** to each individual to-do item. That means we can change the data stored in each instance of `TodoItem`!

Try tapping on a few to-do items. You will see that the code on line 44 toggles the value of the `Bool`, or boolean, `done` property.

When `done` is `true`, it becomes `false`.

When `done` is `false`, it becomes `true`.

This what is means to "toggle" a boolean value.

The `ItemView` structure takes [care of displaying the appropriate SF Symbol for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suSEW0qB9F4&t=1465s).

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Can now mark item as being done or not by tapping.
```

## Discussion

Right now, two immediate issues exist:

1. We cannot modify the text of a to-do item.
2. If we quit the app, the to-do items we created are lost.

In the next part of this tutorial, you will learn how fix these issues, making more use of bindings, and the **SwiftData** framework to persist the to-do items within a database.
