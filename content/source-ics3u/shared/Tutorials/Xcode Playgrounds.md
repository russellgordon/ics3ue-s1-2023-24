Xcode is a large application that serves many purposes for software developers.

Among many other tasks that they perform on a regular basis, software developers write code.

However, we – as *you* are now a software developer – do not always want to write code as part of a large project.

That is where an *Xcode playground* is useful – it is a place to try out ideas with code outside of the context of a large project.

## Make a new playground

To create a playground, make sure that Xcode is in the foreground on your computer by clicking it's icon in the Dock:

From the menu bar at top left, choose **File > New > Playground...**:

You will see the following window – here, choose the ==**macOS**== tab, then **Blank**, and then **Next**:

On the next screen, you are choosing where to save your playground.

You may see a window that looks like the one below – if you do, press the button with the downward facing arrow to open the larger file navigation interface:

Now you have the ability to see your **Finder** shortcuts (at left) and more easily navigate around the file system on your computer:

Keep things organized.

Navigate to the folder where you want to save your Xcode playground.

For example, you might navigate to your **Desktop**, then use the **New Folder** button to create a folder for the course you are in:

Finally, save your playground using a descriptive name.

What name you select will depend on what concept or idea you are exploring:
