## Objective
Reproduce the user interface for part of an app.
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] Xcode
- [ ] the [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) installed on your computer, also for reference
- [ ] your copy of SwiftUI Views Mastery, downloaded to your computer, so you can look up examples as needed
## Success criteria

*I will know I've been highly successful when...*

- [ ] I've made a rough plan where I have identified how various structures might be used: `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`, `Image`, et cetera
> [!NOTE]
> This plan must be shared on Notion in a portfolio post *prior* to writing code.
- [ ] I've accurately reproduced my assigned user interface
> [!NOTE]
> If you complete the work across multiple days, please make multiple portfolio posts to share your progress.
- [ ] I have made use of custom structures to reduce the use of repetitive code â€“ in other words, I've applied *abstraction*
- [ ] I authored code that is well-formatted and easy to read
- [ ] I used source control well by committing and pushing my work to a remote on GitHub at regular intervals

## Mini-exemplar
Given an interface you wish to reproduce:

Here is what a rough plan to reproduce part of an interface might look like:

The rest of the task is to reproduce an app's interface, like you did the Stopwatch tab in the Clock app.

## Selecting an interface to reproduce
See Mr. Gordon when you are ready to begin this task.

You will select or be assigned an interface to reproduce. This will be sent to you by email.

## Learning goals
Successful completion of this task is great initial evidence for learning goals [[Learning Goals#1|1]], [[Learning Goals#2|2]], [[Learning Goals#3|3]], and [[Learning Goals#5|5]].
