## Introduction

Recently we looked at how Jordi Bruin solved a small problem – visually translating a menu – with the [Cibo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cibo-visual-menu-translator/id1583992402) app.

Sometimes, we can help others with major efforts, like writing an app, but... how do we get to that place?

Is writing an app the only way to help others?

## Instructions
