## Introduction

You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`.

You have already built – or will build soon – applications that accept user input in these ways:

1. As an `Int` [[Interactive Apps|via the Stepper structure]]
2. As a  `Double` [[Separation of Concerns|via the Slider structure]].

Steppers and sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input.

This is *very* helpful, however, in the case of:

- a Slider – it can be hard to select a precise value.
- a Stepper – it can be slow to input a large number.

Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept "free form" or typed input from the user.

What happens, though, when invalid input is received from a user?

For example, our app might expect numeric input – but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`.

This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful.

Try each page of the playground by following instructions given, while taking notes in your black paper notebook.

Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book.

When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Notion post](https://notion.so) for today – as well as any questions you have.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to include several screenshots showing your progress as you completed the playground.
