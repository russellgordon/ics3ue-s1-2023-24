As you work through this recap, you may wish to take notes in your black graph paper notebook.

Aim to understand and recall rather than rush to complete this recap as soon as you can.

## Describing Data
### Variables vs. Constants

A variable or a constant can store a single piece of information.

Use a variable when the information to be stored *may* change over time:

```swift
var age = 16
```

Use a constant when the information, once stored, will *never* change while your app runs:

```swift
let accelerationDueToGravity = 9.8
```
### Data Types

Information that is stored always has a *data type*. Common data types in the Swift programming language are:

|Data Type|Example|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`String`|`"Hello world!"`|Text (words, sentences, paragraphs)|
|`Int`|`-27, 0, 5`|An integer value|
|`Float`|`-2.311, 0.3, 5.191231`|32-[bit](https://phoenixnap.com/glossary/bit-vs-byte) floating point value|
|`Double`|`-5.213412324, 3.141592653589793`|64-bit floating point value, provides more precision than a `Float`, default type for non-integer values in Swift|
|`Bool`|`true` or `false`|Either of these two values|

> [!TIP]
> Optionally, read more about the [difference between the Float and Double data types](https://www.codingem.com/double-vs-float-swift/).

When a variable or constant is created, the data type can be *inferred* or guessed at by the Swift programming language compiler. This is called *type inference*.

### Structures

To describe truly useful information *individual* variables and constants do not cover our needs.

Think of a group of dogs:

![[dogs.jpg]]

To describe dogs *in general*, we might want to keep track of information such as:

- breed
- color
- height
- length
- mass

... along with many other possible attributes.

This would be unwieldy using separate individual variables.

Instead, we *define a structure* to group related variables and constants.

For example, we might begin with this:

```swift
struct Dog {
    let breed: String
    let color: String
    var heightInMetres: Double
}
```

The name of the structure is `Dog` and it has three properties: 

- a constant named `breed`
- a constant named `color`
- a variable named `heightInMetres`

We use *type annotation* to describe the data type of each property:

- `breed` is a `String`
- `color` is a `String`
- `heightInMetres` is a `Double`.

> [!TIP]
> It is customary for the name of a structure to always be *singular*, not plural.

To describe *specific dogs* we in turn create *instances* of the type we have defined. For example:

```swift
var dogAtLeft = Dog(
	breed: "English Bulldog",
	color: "Light brown, some white.",
	heightInMetres: 0.457
)

var dogInMiddle = Dog(
	breed: "German Shepherd",
	color: "Black and dark brown.",
	heightInMetres: 0.753
)
```

We can create as many instances of the `Dog` data type as we want.

Each instance of the `Dog` data type corresponds to an actual physical dog.

> 4. Now complete the `Dog` structure described earlier. Add properties to store the length and mass. Choose appropriate names (consider units) and data types.
> 
> 5. Extend the `Dog` stucture. What additional attributes of a dog might it be useful to keep track of? Add properties to your structure to account for those additional attributes.

### Computed properties

Consider the initial `Dog` structure described earlier:

```swift
struct Dog {
    let breed: String
    let color: String
    var heightInMetres: Double
}
```

Each of the three properties shown are *stored properties*.

When an instance of the `Dog` structure is created, we must provide *initial values* for each stored property:

```swift
var dogAtLeft = Dog(
	breed: "English Bulldog",
	color: "Light brown, some white.",
	heightInMetres: 0.457
)
```

However, it is sometimes useful to *compute* new information using existing information kept within an instance of a structure.

For example, while it was convenient to describe a dog's height in metres when creating a structure, somewhere else within an app we write, it might be helpful to show the dog's height in centimetres.

This is best accomplished using a *computed property*, like so:

```swift
struct Dog {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties
    let breed: String
    let color: String
    var heightInMetres: Double
    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var heightInCentimetres: Double {
        return heightInMetres * 100
    }
    
}
```

By using a computed property, we ensure that the same information is not repeated within the structure – it is not efficient to *store* the height twice (once in metres, once in centimetres).

Instead, we store the height once in metres, then *compute* the height in centimetres on demand.

Remember, **D.R.Y.** – *don't repeat yourself*.
> [!QUESTION]

> 6. Add another computed property that returns the ratio of the length and height of a dog. For example, a dog with a length of 1.0 metres and a height of 0.5 metres would have a ratio of 2.0.
> 
> 7. Write an entirely new structure named `Book`. Think of attributes of a book that it would be useful to keep track of. Then create several instances of the `Book` structure within your playground. TIP: If you consider the needs of a large bookstore, the *dimensions* of a physical book would actually be useful to track. What computed property could you add to your structure to help a large bookstore ensure they would have enough shelf space to hold multiple copies of that book?

## Describing User Interfaces

### SwiftUI

SwiftUI is the framework that "sits on top" of the core Swift programming language.

With SwiftUI, we use structures that conform to the `View` protocol to describe a user interface.

For example:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-08 at 9.03.42 PM.png]]

View modifiers are used to adjust the appearance of the user interface.

Remember that the SwiftUI Views Mastery book is a very important reference when authoring interfaces:

Be sure you have a copy of that book on your computer. If you do not, ask Mr. Gordon for assistance with downloading your copy from the publisher.
