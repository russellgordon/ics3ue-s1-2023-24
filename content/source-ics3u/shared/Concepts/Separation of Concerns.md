As our apps grow in size and complexity, how code is organized within a project becomes more important.

This activity will introduce you to the difference between a *view* and a *model*.

It will show you, on a practical level, how keeping view code and model code separated makes our projects easier to understand as a software developer.
## Views

A *view* is anything the user sees within our apps or interacts with.

For example, in the [[Interactive Apps]] activity you considered this view â€“Â a structure designed to show a single item within a list â€“ displaying a title and a subtitle:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.54.10â€¯AM.png]]

You have already written many views while learning about layout and designing interfaces with SwiftUI. ðŸ¤©

## Model

The *model* within an app stores the data and logic related to that data.

What does that mean? 

Let's look at an example â€“Â here is a model for a circle:

```swift
struct Circle {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties
    var radius: Double
    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var diameter: Double {
        return 2 * radius
    }
    
    var perimeter: Double {
        return 2 * Double.pi * radius
    }
    
    var area: Double{
        return Double.pi * radius * radius
    }
}
```

When we write a structure to serve as part of the model for our app, we consider:

1. What data it needs to store â€“ these become *stored properties*.
2. What logic it should offer â€“ what useful information it could provide â€“ these become *computed properties* .

So: the term *model* is new to you, but it is something you've already been doing.

You have already created many models when authoring Swift structures to describe shapes, hockey cards, report cards, book listings... ðŸš€

## Example: Geometry Helper

Let's now put it all together and apply the concept of *separation of concerns*.

We will write an app named *Geometry Helper* and it's job will be to:

- accept input that describes the dimensions of a 2D or 3D figure
- produce output that provides the:
	- area and perimeter (for 2D figures)
	- surface area and volume (for 3D figures)

When the first page of our app is complete, it will look something like this:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-16_06.30.21.gif|300]]

In this case, the user uses a slider control to provide *input* which is the radius of a circle.

Output includes the:

- diameter
- area
- perimeter

### Create the project

To get started, create a [[iOS Projects|new iOS project named *GeometryHelper*]]:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.33.45â€¯AM.png]]

### Source control

After creating the project:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.40.50â€¯AM.png]]

... switch to the **Source Control** navigator using the **Command-2** keyboard shortcut, then select **Repositories**:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.41.32â€¯AM.png]]

Select the **GeometryHelper** entry and you will see the list of commits, which has only one since the project was just created:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.42.24â€¯AM.png]]

Now two-finger tap on the **GeometryHelper** entry and create a remote:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.11.30â€¯AM.png|300]]

Press **Create** on this dialog:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.42.52â€¯AM.png]]

After creating the remote, you will see two small badges in the list of commits:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.43.32â€¯AM.png]]

Right now, both the local copy of our code, and the remote copy of our code, are at the same position (have the same commits).

As a general rule, we try to keep these copies synchronized. 

If the remote repository `origin/main` ever falls behind the local repository `origin` then we can fix this by pushing all local commits up to the remote, using the menu sequence **Integrate > Push...**.
### Project organization

Press **Command-1** to return to the project navigator:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.47.46â€¯AM.png]]

To keep things organized, we will create *groups* â€“ essentially folders â€“ to keep our view code and model code separated.

Create a group named **Views** now:

![[Creating a Group.gif]]

Then create a second group named **Model**:

![[Create the Model Group.gif]]

We want to be deliberate with naming choices when we write software, so that code is as readable as possible.

So, we are now going to delete `ContentView`:

![[Deleting ContentView.gif]]

And create a new view, inside the **Views** group, named `CircleView`:

![[Creating CircleView.gif]]

Finally, as you learned in the [[Running Your Code]] tutorial, the app entry point file controls what view is shown when the app is run in the **Simulator** or on a physical device.

We need to update this file so that it creates an instance of `CircleView`, rather than `ContentView` (which we just deleted).

Let's do that now:

![[Update the App Entry Point.gif]]

Finally, by convention, the app entry point file should be the first file listed in our project.

Drag and drop that file so that it is above the **Model** group:

![[Drag App Entry Point to Top.gif]]

After completing all of this organization, please commit and push your work using this message:

```
Organized project by adding Views and Model groups and a new view file named CircleView.
```

Here is a quick recap of how to commit and push your work:

![[Committing and Pushing.gif]]

### Build the interface

Open the **Model** and **Views** groups and click on the `CircleView` file:

![[Opening Groups.gif]]

Inside `CircleView` add comments to mark stored and computed properties:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.18.05â€¯AM.png]]

First we will create a stored property to keep track of the radius for a circle â€“Â make the following addition to your code:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.19.29â€¯AM.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> As you learned in the [[Interactive Apps]], we mark the property with the `@State` property wrapper. This means that when the stored property changes, SwiftUI will update the user interface for us.

Next we will add a `Text` view to show the contents of the `radius` property:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.21.16â€¯AM.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> As you learned in [[Interactive Apps]], the syntax `\( )` represents *string interpolation* and in this case:
> 
> `\(radius)`
> 
> ... is converting the numeric data, the radius, into a string so that it can be displayed by the `Text` view.

This is good progress that we don't want to lose, so please commit and push your work now with this message:

```
Added a stored property and a Text view to show the radius.
```

Finally, we will add a  `Slider` control that has a binding to the stored property, inside of a `VStack`:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.24.56â€¯AM.png]]

We use `$radius` bind the `Slider` to the `radius` stored property:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.25.43â€¯AM.png]]

And we provide an argument of `0...100` for the **in** parameter so that the slider can move only between the values of zero to 100:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.26.41â€¯AM.png]]

Finally, a bit of padding keeps the interface from touching the edges of the device:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.27.11â€¯AM.png]]

You can now drag the slider, and see the radius change on screen:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.28.10â€¯AM.png]]

This is great progress, so commit and push your work now with this message:

```
Added a slider to let the user change the radius of the circle.
```

### Add the model

What we will do next is add the model code.

First, create a new file in the **Model** group named `Circle`:

![[Create a Model for a Circle.gif]]

Then, you can copy and paste this code:

```swift
struct Circle {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties
    var radius: Double
    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var diameter: Double {
        return 2 * radius
    }
    
    var perimeter: Double {
        return 2 * Double.pi * radius
    }
    
    var area: Double{
        return Double.pi * radius * radius
    }
}
```

... into the new `Circle` file:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.32.47â€¯AM.png]]

Please commit and push you work with this message:

```
Added a model file to describe a circle.
```

### Use the model

Now that we have added the model file to our project, we can use it directly in our app.

Rather than re-create individual properties *within our view* for the radius of a circle, and then computed properties for the diameter, area, and perimeter... we can just *use the existing code* that already exists in the `Circle` structure.

Replace the old code on line 13 (in grey) with the new code (in blue):

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.37.31â€¯AM.png]]

Above, we make a stored property in our *view* that is simply an instance of our `Circle` structure.

The instance of our `Circle` structure is called `currentCircle`.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating an instance of the `Circle` structure on line 13 is the same thing we did earlier in this course within a simple playground file, shown below on line 23:
> 
> ![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.39.51â€¯AM.png]]

Next, in our `CircleView` file on line 22, we change the slider so that it has a binding to the `radius` property that is inside the `currentCircle` instance of `Circle` structure:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.41.22â€¯AM.png]]

Finally, on line 19, we adjust the `Text` view so that it shows the value being stored in the `radius` property of the `currentCircle` instance:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.42.54â€¯AM.png]]

Let's break down what is happening in detail:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.45.38â€¯AM.png]]

> [!DISCUSSION]
> 1. We create an instance of the `Circle` structure named `currentCircle`.
>    
>    We set the radius to `10.0` initially.
>    
>    Since `currentCircle` is a property marked with `@State`, whenever any sub-properties are changed, such as `radius`, the user interface will be updated by SwiftUI.
>    
> 2. The slider has a binding to `$currentCircle.radius` which allows the user to change the value of the `radius` sub-property of `currentCircle`.
>    
> 3. When data inside `currentCircle` changes, SwiftUI updates the `Text` view to show the new radius.

This is great progress, so commit and push your work with this message:

```
In our view, we are now making use of the existing Circle structure from our model.
```

### Use computed properties of the model

Now that we are using the `Circle` structure from our model, without much additional effort, we can show output from any of it's existing computed properties. ðŸŽ‰

For example, make this addition to your code, so that the diameter of the circle is shown in the view:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.54.48â€¯AM.png]]

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Now using a computed property from the Circle structure to show the diameter of the circle on screen.
```

## Exercises

### Improve the interface

Using your knowledge of stacks, spacers, and custom structures, improve the user interface of `CircleView` so that it looks something more like this:

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-16_07.56.59.png|300]]

You may find [this formula sheet useful](https://www.eqao.com/wp-content/uploads/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf) for capturing necessary screenshots.

### Add your own structure

Earlier in this course, you wrote a structure that described a 2D or 3D shape [from this formula sheet](https://www.eqao.com/wp-content/uploads/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf).

For example, say your task earlier in this module was to create a structure that describes a cone.

You would copy your existing code that describes a cone into a new file named `Cone` within the **Model** group:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.59.40â€¯AM.png]]

Then you would create a new file named `ConeView` within the **View** group:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 8.02.36â€¯AM.png]]

Then, apply the skills you've learned in this activity to make an interface that allows the user to provide all necessary inputs for your figure. 

For a cone, you would need sliders for the radius of the base, $r$, the height of the cone, $h$, and the slant height of the cone, $s$:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 8.01.34â€¯AM.png|200]]

Finally, you would use `Text` views to show output from the computed properties for the surface area and volume.
