As our apps grow in size and complexity, how code is organized within a project becomes more important.

This activity will introduce you to the difference between a *view* and a *model*.

It will show you, on a practical level, how keeping view code and model code separated makes our projects easier to understand as a software developer.
## Views

A *view* is anything the user sees within our apps or interacts with.

For example, in the [[Interactive Apps]] activity you considered this view – a structure designed to show a single item within a list – displaying a title and a subtitle:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.54.10 AM.png]]

You have already written many views while learning about layout and designing interfaces with SwiftUI. 🤩

## Model

The *model* within an app stores the data and logic related to that data.

What does that mean? 

Let's look at an example – here is a model for a circle:

```swift
struct Circle {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties
    var radius: Double
    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var diameter: Double {
        return 2 * radius
    }
    
    var perimeter: Double {
        return 2 * Double.pi * radius
    }
    
    var area: Double{
        return Double.pi * radius * radius
    }
}
```

When we write a structure to serve as part of the model for our app, we consider:

1. What data it needs to store – these become *stored properties*.
2. What logic it should offer – what useful information it could provide – these become *computed properties* .

So: the term *model* is new to you, but it is something you've already been doing.

You have already created many models when authoring Swift structures to describe shapes, hockey cards, report cards, book listings... 🚀

## Example: Geometry Helper

Let's now put it all together and apply the concept of *separation of concerns*.

We will write an app named *Geometry Helper* and it's job will be to:

- accept input that describes the dimensions of a 2D or 3D figure
- produce output that provides the:
	- area and perimeter (for 2D figures)
	- surface area and volume (for 3D figures)

When the first page of our app is complete, it will look something like this:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-16_06.30.21.gif|300]]

In this case, the user uses a slider control to provide *input* which is the radius of a circle.

Output includes the:

- diameter
- area
- perimeter

### Create the project

To get started, create a [[iOS Projects|new iOS project named *GeometryHelper*]]:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.33.45 AM.png]]

### Source control

After creating the project:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.40.50 AM.png]]

... switch to the **Source Control** navigator using the **Command-2** keyboard shortcut, then select **Repositories**:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.41.32 AM.png]]

Select the **GeometryHelper** entry and you will see the list of commits, which has only one since the project was just created:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.42.24 AM.png]]

Now two-finger tap on the **GeometryHelper** entry and create a remote:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.11.30 AM.png|300]]

Press **Create** on this dialog:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.42.52 AM.png]]

After creating the remote, you will see two small badges in the list of commits:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.43.32 AM.png]]

Right now, both the local copy of our code, and the remote copy of our code, are at the same position (have the same commits).

As a general rule, we try to keep these copies synchronized. 

If the remote repository `origin/main` ever falls behind the local repository `origin` then we can fix this by pushing all local commits up to the remote, using the menu sequence **Integrate > Push...**.
### Project organization

Press **Command-1** to return to the project navigator:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 6.47.46 AM.png]]

To keep things organized, we will create *groups* – essentially folders – to keep our view code and model code separated.

Create a group named **Views** now:

![[Creating a Group.gif]]

Then create a second group named **Model**:

![[Create the Model Group.gif]]

We want to be deliberate with naming choices when we write software, so that code is as readable as possible.

So, we are now going to delete `ContentView`:

![[Deleting ContentView.gif]]

And create a new view, inside the **Views** group, named `CircleView`:

![[Creating CircleView.gif]]

Finally, as you learned in the [[Running Your Code]] tutorial, the app entry point file controls what view is shown when the app is run in the **Simulator** or on a physical device.

We need to update this file so that it creates an instance of `CircleView`, rather than `ContentView` (which we just deleted).

Let's do that now:

![[Update the App Entry Point.gif]]

Finally, by convention, the app entry point file should be the first file listed in our project.

Drag and drop that file so that it is above the **Model** group:

![[Drag App Entry Point to Top.gif]]

After completing all of this organization, please commit and push your work using this message:

```
Organized project by adding Views and Model groups and a new view file named CircleView.
```

Here is a quick recap of how to commit and push your work:

![[Committing and Pushing.gif]]

### Build the interface

Open the **Model** and **Views** groups and click on the `CircleView` file:

![[Opening Groups.gif]]

Inside `CircleView` add comments to mark stored and computed properties:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.18.05 AM.png]]

First we will create a stored property to keep track of the radius for a circle – make the following addition to your code:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.19.29 AM.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> As you learned in the [[Interactive Apps]], we mark the property with the `@State` property wrapper. This means that when the stored property changes, SwiftUI will update the user interface for us.

Next we will add a `Text` view to show the contents of the `radius` property:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.21.16 AM.png]]

> [!NOTE]
> As you learned in [[Interactive Apps]], the syntax `\( )` represents *string interpolation* and in this case:
> 
> `\(radius)`
> 
> ... is converting the numeric data, the radius, into a string so that it can be displayed by the `Text` view.

This is good progress that we don't want to lose, so please commit and push your work now with this message:

```
Added a stored property and a Text view to show the radius.
```

Finally, we will add a  `Slider` control that has a binding to the stored property, inside of a `VStack`:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.24.56 AM.png]]

We use `$radius` bind the `Slider` to the `radius` stored property:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.25.43 AM.png]]

And we provide an argument of `0...100` for the **in** parameter so that the slider can move only between the values of zero to 100:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.26.41 AM.png]]

Finally, a bit of padding keeps the interface from touching the edges of the device:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.27.11 AM.png]]

You can now drag the slider, and see the radius change on screen:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.28.10 AM.png]]

This is great progress, so commit and push your work now with this message:

```
Added a slider to let the user change the radius of the circle.
```

### Add the model

What we will do next is add the model code.

First, create a new file in the **Model** group named `Circle`:

![[Create a Model for a Circle.gif]]

Then, you can copy and paste this code:

```swift
struct Circle {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties
    var radius: Double
    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var diameter: Double {
        return 2 * radius
    }
    
    var perimeter: Double {
        return 2 * Double.pi * radius
    }
    
    var area: Double{
        return Double.pi * radius * radius
    }
}
```

... into the new `Circle` file:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.32.47 AM.png]]

Please commit and push you work with this message:

```
Added a model file to describe a circle.
```

### Use the model

Now that we have added the model file to our project, we can use it directly in our app.

Rather than re-create individual properties *within our view* for the radius of a circle, and then computed properties for the diameter, area, and perimeter... we can just *use the existing code* that already exists in the `Circle` structure.

Replace the old code on line 13 (in grey) with the new code (in blue):

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.37.31 AM.png]]

Above, we make a stored property in our *view* that is simply an instance of our `Circle` structure.

The instance of our `Circle` structure is called `currentCircle`.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating an instance of the `Circle` structure on line 13 is the same thing we did earlier in this course within a simple playground file, shown below on line 23:
> 
> ![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.39.51 AM.png]]

Next, in our `CircleView` file on line 22, we change the slider so that it has a binding to the `radius` property that is inside the `currentCircle` instance of `Circle` structure:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.41.22 AM.png]]

Finally, on line 19, we adjust the `Text` view so that it shows the value being stored in the `radius` property of the `currentCircle` instance:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.42.54 AM.png]]

Let's break down what is happening in detail:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.45.38 AM.png]]

> [!DISCUSSION]
> 1. We create an instance of the `Circle` structure named `currentCircle`.
>    
>    We set the radius to `10.0` initially.
>    
>    Since `currentCircle` is a property marked with `@State`, whenever any sub-properties are changed, such as `radius`, the user interface will be updated by SwiftUI.
>    
> 2. The slider has a binding to `$currentCircle.radius` which allows the user to change the value of the `radius` sub-property of `currentCircle`.
>    
> 3. When data inside `currentCircle` changes, SwiftUI updates the `Text` view to show the new radius.

This is great progress, so commit and push your work with this message:

```
In our view, we are now making use of the existing Circle structure from our model.
```

### Use computed properties of the model

Now that we are using the `Circle` structure from our model, without much additional effort, we can show output from any of it's existing computed properties. 🎉

For example, make this addition to your code, so that the diameter of the circle is shown in the view:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.54.48 AM.png]]

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Now using a computed property from the Circle structure to show the diameter of the circle on screen.
```

## Exercises

### Improve the interface

Using your knowledge of stacks, spacers, and custom structures, improve the user interface of `CircleView` so that it looks something more like this:

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-16_07.56.59.png|300]]

You may find [this formula sheet useful](https://www.eqao.com/wp-content/uploads/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf) for capturing necessary screenshots.

### Add your own structure

Earlier in this course, you wrote a structure that described a 2D or 3D shape [from this formula sheet](https://www.eqao.com/wp-content/uploads/g9-formula-sheet-academic.pdf).

For example, say your task earlier in this module was to create a structure that describes a cone.

You would copy your existing code that describes a cone into a new file named `Cone` within the **Model** group:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 7.59.40 AM.png]]

Then you would create a new file named `ConeView` within the **View** group:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 8.02.36 AM.png]]

Then, apply the skills you've learned in this activity to make an interface that allows the user to provide all necessary inputs for your figure. 

For a cone, you would need sliders for the radius of the base, $r$, the height of the cone, $h$, and the slant height of the cone, $s$:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-16 at 8.01.34 AM.png|200]]

Finally, you would use `Text` views to show output from the computed properties for the surface area and volume.
