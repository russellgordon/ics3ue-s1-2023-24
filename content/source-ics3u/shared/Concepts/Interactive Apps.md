# Introduction to Interactive Apps

In this lesson you will learn how to build a simple interactive application using SwiftUI.

A small extension to what you already know about structures is all that you need to make an interactive app.

## Structures

You have learned how to author structures that describe a variety of things we interact with each day.

### Recap of syntax

Here are some examples of structures...

A person:

```swift
struct Person {

	let name: String
	var heightInCentimetres: Double

	var heightInMetres: Double {
		return heightInCentimetres / 100
	}
	
}
```

A container to hold liquids:

```swift
struct Bottle {

	let manufacturer: String
	var volumeInLitres: Double

	var volumeInMillilitres: Double {
		return volumeInLitres / 1000
	}
	
}
```

Part of a user interface, also known as a *view*:

```swift
struct ListItem: View {

    let title: String
    var subtitle: String

    var body: some View {
        
        VStack {
            HStack {
                Text(title)
                    .font(.headline)
                Spacer()
            }
            HStack {
                Text(subtitle)
                Spacer()
            }
        }
        .padding()
        
    }
    
}
```

Each of the structures shown above have *two* stored properties and *one* computed property.

As a convention, in a structure, we will always list *stored properties* first and then *computed properties*.

Going forward, it is a good idea to *mark* which properties are stored properties and which properties are computed properties, using short comments.

Like this:

```swift
struct Person {

	// MARK: Stored properties
	let name: String
	var heightInCentimetres: Double

	// MARK: Computed properties
	var heightInMetres: Double {
		return heightInCentimetres / 100
	}
	
}
```

A container to hold liquids:

```swift
struct Bottle {

	// MARK: Stored properties
	let manufacturer: String
	var volumeInLitres: Double

	// MARK: Computed properties
	var volumeInMillilitres: Double {
		return volumeInLitres / 1000
	}
	
}
```

A user interface element:

```swift
struct ListItem: View {

    // MARK: Stored properties
    let title: String
    var subtitle: String

    // MARK: Computed properties
    var body: some View {
        
        VStack {
            HStack {
                Text(title)
                    .font(.headline)
                Spacer()
            }
            HStack {
                Text(subtitle)
                Spacer()
            }
        }
        .padding()
        
    }
    
}
```

### Stored vs. computed properties

Stored properties become questions – or *parameters* – that we must answer – provide *arguments* for – when we create an instance of a structure.

For example:

```swift
var myTeacher = Person(
	name: "Mr. Gordon",
	heightInCentimetres: 180.0
)
```

Here, the *parameters* are:

- `name`
- `heightInCentimetres`

The arguments are:

- `Mr. Gordon`
- `180.0`

The values we provide with these arguments are kept in each stored property. We see this when we run code within a Playground:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.35.06 AM.png|450]]

And of course, we do *not* need to provide arguments for computed properties.

Instead, the computer calculates the output of computed properties for us.

For example:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.36.27 AM.png|500]]

Structures that are views work the same way.

Here is the `ListItem` structure, with different arguments passed for the instances shown in each preview.

This results in different visual output from the computed property named `body`.

Here is the output from the first instance of `ListItem`, shown in the first preview:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.53.39 AM.png]]

Here is the output from the second instance of `ListItem`, shown in the second preview:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 11.54.10 AM.png]]

### Property wrappers

Let's say we want to make a simple app that shows the square of a given number.

It will work like this:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-14_12.06.11 1.gif|300]]

To create this app, all we need is a structure.

One piece of information is a stored property – the base.

One piece of information is a computed property – the squared value.

Let's build this app step by step.

First, we'll make a static layout, with a specific example of a number being squared:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 12.13.06 PM.png]]

Here we have several text views, stacks, and spacers to express the general layout we want to build.

Please now create a [[iOS Projects|new iOS project]] named **StepperExample**.

Then, feel free to copy the code provided here to get started:

```swift
//
//  ContentView.swift
//  StepperExample
//

import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    
    // MARK: Stored properties

    
    // MARK: Computed properties
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            
            Spacer()
            
            HStack(alignment: .top) {

                Text("5")
                    .font(.system(size: 96))

                Text("2")
                    .font(.system(size: 44))

                Text("=")
                    .font(.system(size: 96))

                Text("25")
                    .font(.system(size: 96))
            }
                        
            Spacer()
        }
        .padding()
    }
}

#Preview {
    ContentView()
}

```

After adding that code, go ahead and commit your work with this message:

```
Created the initial static layout.
```

As you can see, there are currently no stored properties, and just one computed property, `body`, which describes the user interface.

We need to store some information – some *state* – to allow the user to control what the base of the power is.

Add this stored property to your view now:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 12.17.38 PM.png]]

Note that since we provide a default value of `1` for that stored property, we do not need to provide an argument to populate the stored property, when creating the instance of `ContentView` from within the `#Preview` section of our code:

```swift
#Preview {
    ContentView()
}
```

We have made the `base` stored property a *variable*, which means it's value can change:

```swift
var base: Int = 1
```

However, we also need to use a *property wrapper* called `@State`, like this:

```swift
@State var base: Int = 1
```

What does `@State` do?

**It tells SwiftUI that when a property's value does change, the user interface should  be updated automatically.** That's really important.

`@State` before a property in a structure ensures SwiftUI will update the user interface  when that property's value changes.

So, please add the property wrapper to your code now:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 12.20.59 PM.png]]

Finally, let's make a change to our code, so the value of the `base` stored property is actually used in our layout. Remember – old code is shown in grey – new code is shown in light blue:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 12.24.59 PM.png]]

Of course, this now means that our user interface presents incorrect information, since $1^2\neq25$, but we will fix that soon.

Go ahead and commit your work with this message:

```
Added a stored property to hold the base of the power selected by the user.
```

### Bindings to a control

So now we have a stored property named `base` and when it changes, the user interface will be automatically updated by SwiftUI.

How do we let the user actually *change* the property, though?

That's what a *control* and a *binding* are for.

We will add a *stepper* control to our project. A stepper is useful for allowing the user to provide integer input; they can increase or decrease a value by tapping `+` or `-`.

Use the auto-complete to begin adding a stepper below the `HStack`:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.17.14 PM.png]]

There are many ways to make a stepper, but choose the option shown.

You will end up with this code:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.18.03 PM.png]]

Errors appear because we have not replaced the placeholders.

Let's do that now.

For the first placeholder, replace it with `$base`:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.19.09 PM.png]]

For the second placeholder, begin by typing a `{` and then press the **Return** key on your keyboard so you get this:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.19.50 PM.png]]

Finally, inside the `{ }` brackets, add a `Text` view – this will be a label for the stepper, telling the user what value is being adjusted when they press the `+` or `-` buttons:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.25.53 PM.png]]

Now, let's break down in detail what is happening there:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.23.44 PM.png]]

> [!DISCUSSION]
> 1. In the `Stepper`, for the `value` parameter, we pass an argument of `$base`.
>    
>    The `$` is special syntax that means this is a *binding*.
>    
>    What is a binding? It means the stepper is bound, or directly connected to, the `base` stored property, in this example.
>    
>    So, as the stepper's controls are tapped by the user, the value of the `base` stored property is changed.
>    
>    And, since we marked that stored property with `@State`, the user interface will automatically be updated.
> 2. For the `label` parameter, we pass a code block that starts with a `{` and ends with a `}`. This type of code block is also called a *closure*.
>    
>    Inside the closure that is passed as the argument for the `label` parameter, we provide a `Text` view.
>    
>    The `Text` view inside the closure provides the visual output that we see beside the stepper control. In this case, it is simply text that says "Base".

If you try the app now, as the stepper is tapped, the text view that shows the base is updated automatically – that happens because of the `@State` property wrapper:

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-14_13.31.53.gif|300]]

At this point, we should commit our work with the following message:

```
Added a stepper control that is bound to the "base" stored property. The user can now click to change the base in the app's interface.
```

### String interpolation

We have one final step to complete.

The app does not currently show the correct square of a given base – instead, it shows 25 – that part of the layout is still static (meaning constant, or unchanging).

Let's fix that now.

We have a stored property that the user can change using a stepper control.

That's our *input*.

We want to *process* the input, and show *output*.

This is a great place to use a *computed property* for the processing part, and *string interpolation* for the output part.

First, add the following computed property to your structure:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.37.01 PM.png]]

The new computed property is called `squared` and it will update whenever the value of `base` changes – again, thanks to the `@State` property wrapper.

Finally, we need to show the output from the `squared` computed property.

You might think that we could just do what is shown below – note that old code is in grey – new code is in light blue:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.39.31 PM.png]]

However, that generates an error message.

A `Text` view is designed to show, well, text – that is – a `String`.

However, the data type of the `squared` computed property is an `Int`.

This is where string interpolation helps us.

Make the following change – note that old code is in grey – new code is in light blue:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 1.40.57 PM.png]]

By adding this code:

```swift
Text("\(squared)")
```

... we are asking the `Text` view to show a string, because of the `" "` marks.

However, the syntax `\( )` is where how we tell Swift to take whatever we put between the brackets – and change it into a string.

That is called *string interpolation*.

So when we say: `\(squared)` we are asking Swift to convert the `squared` computed property that is an `Int` into a `String`.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing an `Int` into a `String` in this manner only works inside a string literal – that is – in between `" "` marks.

Now, if you try the app – it works!

![[RocketSim_Recording_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-14_13.50.26.gif|300]]

> [!RECAP]
> 
> The stepper changes the `base` stored property via the `$base` binding.
> 
> Since `base` is marked with `@State` the user interface automatically updates.
> 
> The `squared` computed property automatically updates when `base` changes.

Commit and push your work with this message:

```
Finished the app by adding a computed property and using string interpolation.
```

## Exercises

### Fix the presentation

In the program at this point in time, a logical error of sorts exists.

If you use the stepper to reduce the base of the power to a value that is less than zero, it presents a mathematically incorrect statement:

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-14_20.29.43.png|300]]

Of course, $2^2=4$ but $-2^2\neq4$ since the base in the latter expression is only $2$.

That is:

$$
\begin{align}
&=-2^2  \\
&=-1\times2^2 \\
&=-1\times4 \\
&=-4 \\
\end{align}
$$

Fix the user interface in this app so that it presents mathematically correct statements at all times, like this:

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-11-14_20.35.20.png|300]]


### Finding sums

Using your newfound knowledge, write an app that calculates the sum of two numbers, like this:

![[Screenshot 2023-11-06 at 7.21.12 PM.png|300]]

### Finding differences, products, and quotients

If you wish to demonstrate even greater understanding of the concepts at hand, add additional views to your app to allow for subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers:
