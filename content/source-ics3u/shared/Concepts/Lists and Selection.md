So far we have made lists that hold a set number of values, like in the Trading Cards app:

![[Screenshot 2023-01-23 at 8.21.50 PM.png]]

In the screenshot above, on line 67, a list (also called an array) named `allPlayers` was created and holds five elements, with indices from 0 to 4:

|Index|Element|
|-|-|
|0|kellyGruber|
|1|joeCarter|
|2|patBorders|
|3|tonyFernandez|
|4|georgeBell|

However, a great deal of the utility of using a list comes from its flexibility: the number of elements can be *increased* (or decreased) while our program runs.

## Understanding the data structure

Before building an app with a proper user interface, let's take just a bit of time to explore the structure of an array (also known as a list) again.

### Initializing an array

Create a new [[Command-Line Projects|command-line macOS app]] named **DynamicListExamples**, and then copy this code into the `main` file:

```swift
// Create an array of integers that
// holds three random numbers to start
var numbers: [Int] = [

    Int.random(in: 1...100),
    Int.random(in: 1...100),
    Int.random(in: 1...100),

]

// Print the values in the array
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

... like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.36.24 PM.png]]

Run the app a few times by using the **Command-R** keyboard shortcut.

Notice how the numbers in the array change each time. That is because they are randomly generated.

However, there are *always three* elements in the array.

Three elements will exist at indices 0 through 2, inclusive, like this (using values from the screenshot above):

|Index|Element|
|-|-|
|0|56|
|1|77|
|2|59|

You can check for yourself that this is in fact how the array is organized.

Click the left margin of the Xcode interface, where it says line 21, then run your app:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.54.51 PM.png]]

The blue mark in the margin is a *breakpoint*, and you are now debugging your app in real-time.

The green line indicates the line of code that is about to be run. We will use this in a moment.

For now, click near the bottom of the Xcode interface, where it says **Auto↕**, and then select **All Variables, Registers, Globals and Statics**, like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.55.15 PM.png]]

You should then see the following:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.59.16 PM.png]]

Finally, click the disclosure triangle beside `numbers` and you will see the three existing values in the array, and index positions 0, 1, and 2:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.58.21 PM.png]]

If you wish, you can step through the code. Press the **Step Over** button a few times, and you will see the loop print the numbers in the array to the console:

![[Stepping Through Code.gif]]

### Mutating the array

However, what if we want to add more values to the array?

When a data structure is changed, we say it is *mutated*.

We could do this by adding more lines of code after the existing code:

```swift
// Add two more random numbers to the array
numbers.append(Int.random(in: 1...100))
numbers.append(Int.random(in: 1...100))

// Print a divider
print("----------")

// Print the values in the array again
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

... like this – all the code on lines 25 and below is new:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.10.03 PM.png]]

With the new code, from the screenshot above, at first the array contains just three values:

|Index|Element|
|-|-|
|0|21|
|1|35|
|2|55|

However, after the additional elements are appended (added to the end) of the array, it contains:

|Index|Element|
|-|-|
|0|21|
|1|35|
|2|55|
|3|82|
|4|51|

This demonstrates that you *can* mutate, or change, the number of elements in an array after the array is first initialized.

Try this out by running the code and stepping through it – notice how the size of the array changes as the additional lines of code are run:

![[More Stepping Through Code.gif]]

However, we, as the programmer, are still deciding to add two more elements, and *we* are writing the code to make that happen.

What if we want to change the elements in the array at *run time*?

That is... while the program is running?

By letting the user decide?

We can do that.

### Mutating at run time

First, let's clear the breakpoint on line 21, like this:

![[Clearing a Breakpoint.gif]]

Then add the code below to the bottom of the existing code in your app:

```swift
// Print a divider
print("----------")

// Ask the user how many more numbers to add to the array
print("How many more elements would you like to add to the array? ", terminator: "")
let additionalElementCount = Int(readLine()!)!

// Prompt the user to add more elements
for _ in 0..<additionalElementCount {
    print("Please enter a number: ", terminator: "")
    let newValue = Int(readLine()!)!
    numbers.append(newValue)
}

// Print a divider
print("----------")

// Print the values in the array a third time
for number in numbers {
    print(number)
}
```

... like this – everything on line 37 and after is new:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.23.41 PM.png]]

Now set a breakpoint on line 38, and another breakpoint on line 52, like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.28.32 PM.png]]

Try running the program.

It will stop just before the user – you – will be prompted to add more elements to the array.

Notice how there are currently *five* elements in the array:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.29.33 PM.png]]

If you press the **Continue program execution** button:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.30.35 PM.png]]

... you will be prompted to add as many new elements to the array as you want.

Choosing a value less than 10 is recommended unless you *really* enjoy typing numbers into a computer!

Notice that when the program stops at the second breakpoint, the size of the array has grown by however many elements you chose to add:

![[Adding Elements to an Array.gif]]

So, that is a recap of how arrays are structured.

We have shown that we can place elements in an array:

- when it is first initialized
	- this is what we did in Trading Cards, Landmarks, and similar apps
- after it is initialized
	- we can change an array's contents after it is first created
- at run time
	- the user can control how many new elements are added to an array

## Exercise

Let's apply the idea of *dynamically changing* the contents of an array in a real app.

### Create the project

Create a [[iOS Projects|new iOS project]] or a [[macOS Projects|new macOS project with a graphical user interface]].

Name the project **GuessingGame**, like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.56.16 PM.png]]

... and be sure to create a remote after you have made the project, like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.56.35 PM.png]]

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 5.56.51 PM.png]]

Now, delete `ContentView`, and then add a new **SwiftUI File** named `GameView`:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 6.51.24 PM.png]]

... and finally, and make the app entry point open `GameView` instead:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 6.51.49 PM.png]]

Before continuing, please commit and push your work with this message:

```
Re-organized project and created a GameView file.
```

### Add starter code

Now, switch back to `GameView`, and [copy-paste this code](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lcs-rgordon/744cd8d0166c9a8ec468f5de41569380/raw/47dd129ded1431288ac2c9f54b37696cca805a55/GameView.swift) into the file, so it looks like this:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 6.53.50 PM.png]]

Try out the interface.

This is a template within which you can complete the logic for a guessing game.

Before continuing, commit and push your work with this message:

```
Added starter code for Guessing Game interface.
```

### Array is mutated at run time

Note how as you submit guesses, they are shown in a scrolling interface on screen.

As you can see, the `guessesMade` array begins completely empty:

```swift
// The list of numbers the user has guessed so far
@State var guessesMade: [Int] = []
```

... but it grows as the user makes guesses, since this code exists in the `checkGuesses` function:

```swift
// Save the user's guesses
guessesMade.append(selectedNumber)
```

For example, in this screenshot, I have made three guesses:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 7.08.28 PM.png]]

... so the `guessesMade` array contains:

|Index|Element|
|-|-|
|0|50|
|1|64|
|2|57|

### Selection statements

To finish the guessing game, you need to add logic here, beginning on line 100:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 7.09.22 PM.png]]

That will require you to compare values to one another, and *selectively* – based on certain *conditions* – set the contents of the `feedback`  variable as needed so the user can make a better guess next time.

There are multiple types of programming language structures that allow for selection to occur.

In this discussion, we will look at `if` statements.

The general syntax is:

![[Pasted image 20221216083514.png|225]]

In that example, only when the `condition` evaluates to `true` does the block of code inside the `{ }` brackets get selected to be run. Otherwise, the block of code is skipped.

Here is another example:

![[Pasted image 20221216083829.png|175]]

In that example, when the `condition` is `true` the first block of code runs. Otherwise, `else`,  the second block of code runs.

And finally, here is a third example – note that as necessary, you can add additional `else if` branches:

![[Pasted image 20221216083829 copy 1.png|245]]

In this example, there would be different conditions in the first and second branches.

So... what is a condition?

A condition is often a comparison of two values. Here are all the ways two numeric values can be compared:

![[Pasted image 20221216090240 1.png|400]]

For example, the following code has a condition, `a > b`:

```swift
let a = 20
let b = 10
if a > b {
	print("a is greater")
} else {
	print("b is greater")
}
```

Since `a` has a value of `20` in that example, the first branch of the `if` statement is run, and second branch is ignored. `a is greater` will be printed on the screen.

### Complete the game

Add logic to the Guessing Game app, beginning on line 100, to guide the player toward making a correct guess:

![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 7.09.22 PM.png]]

You can do that by selectively changing the value of the `feedback` property.

When the user does make a correct guess, be sure to let them know they have won the game.

When you have finished this exercise, commit and push your work using this message:

```
Finished Guessing Game logic by guiding the user toward a correct answer.
```
