A *view* is a structure in SwiftUI that is used to show something to the user.

It's the parts of an app we can *see*.

How to position views is a key skill in building user interfaces for a software developer.

## Stacks

SwiftUI uses three primary *layout* views:

- `VStack`
	- Positions views contained inside of it vertically.
- `HStack`
	- Positions views inside of it horizontally.
- `ZStack`
	- Positions views inside of it using layers.
	- The first view is the bottom layer.
	- The final view is the top layer.

Learning how to do layout in SwiftUI is best done experimentally.

## Example

Let's try to build this view:

![[Pasted image 20231024132912.png|200]]

You can think of this view as a blueprint.

User interface designers call this a "wireframe" or a "block design".

### Shapes

We will build this view using the `Rectangle` shape.

It is an example of a **push-out** view.

A `Rectangle` will push out to fill up as much space as possible, like this:

![[RocketSim_Screenshot_iPhone_15_Pro_2023-10-24_13.49.46.png|250]]

Follow the instructions given in class to create a new iOS project in Xcode.

Then, we will build the view together!
