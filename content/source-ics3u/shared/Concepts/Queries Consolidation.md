## Selecting and Filtering Data

Two classes ago, you learned how to query a single table in a database:

```sql
SELECT birth_date, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 10004 AND 10008
```

We use the `SELECT` keyword to identify <span style="color:lightpink;">columns</span> that should be included in the result.

We use the `FROM` keyword to identify the <span style="color:dodgerblue;">table</span> to select columns from.

We use the `WHERE` keyword to identify <span style="color:darkseagreen;">rows</span> that should be included in the result.

The <span style="color:gold;">intersection</span> of the  included columns and rows is the data that will be returned:

## Aliases

Aliases can be used to rename the header for a column in a result set:

```sql
SELECT 
	birth_date AS "Date of birth",
	first_name AS "First name",
	last_name AS "Last name"
FROM
	employees
WHERE
	emp_id BETWEEN 10004 AND 10008
```

## Functions

Aggregate functions can be used to count or perform arithmetic on numeric values.

- `SUM(column_name)`
	- Add values within a group.
- `AVG(column_name)`
	- Average values within a group.
- `COUNT(column_name)`
	- Count how many values exist within a group.
- `MAX(column_name)`
	- Find the maximum value within a group.
- `MIN(column_name)`
	- Find the minimum value within a group.

For example, we can find the lowest birth date within the same group of rows returned earlier with this query:

```sql
SELECT MIN(birth_date)
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 10004 AND 10008
```

Further, if we combine the `MIN` function with a `GROUP BY` clause, we can find the lowest birth date within each gender group:

```sql
SELECT MIN(birth_date), gender
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id BETWEEN 10004 AND 10008
GROUP BY gender
```

In this case, values that exist in the `gender` column are `M` and `F`.

So, we get the lowest birth date within rows that contain an `M` in the gender column, and we also get the lowest birth date within rows that contain an `F` in the gender column:

> [!TIP]
> When using a function like `MIN` together with the `GROUP BY` clause, it's usually helpful to also select the column you are grouping by. In this case it helps us to see that the lowest birth date among women is `1953-04-20` and the lowest birth date among men is `1954-05-01`.

## Subqueries

Think of subqueries as if you are asking multiple questions of the database, one by one.

For an example of using sub-queries, refer back to the [[Databases (Solutions)#^bad187|solution to question 11 from earlier exercises]].

## Reference Sheet

You are always welcome to refer to the [reference sheet](https://learnsql.com/blog/sql-basics-cheat-sheet/sql-basics-cheat-sheet-letter.pdf) provided earlier while authoring queries.

## Consolidation Exercises

Once you have completed exercises from prior days, check your understanding by trying to answer as many questions in the list below. 

When you feel it is appropriate, join tables to provide more readable results.

Please place screenshots of your responses in a portfolio post [on Notion](https://notion.so).

> [!NOTE]
> Be aware that some of these are pretty challenging! Completing most (not necessarily all) of these exercises would be a great example of exceeding expectations.

For reference when working through these exercises, here again is the database structure:
