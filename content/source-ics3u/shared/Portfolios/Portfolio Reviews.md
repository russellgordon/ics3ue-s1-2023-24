When you author your review, be certain that you use the template provided:

## Use links

The goal is *not* to copy, or reproduce, all the evidence you already have in your portfolio into the review page.

Instead, *link* to the evidence you have already spent time creating.

To make a link in Notion, just highlight some text, then press **Command-K**. Then search for the page that you want to link to within your portfolio.

If you have written longer portfolio entries, it's very helpful to [link directly to a specific heading or any block within a page](https://www.notion.so/help/create-links-and-backlinks#link-to-content-blocks). You can just click on a block, and choose **Copy link to block**. Then use that link in your portfolio review page.

## Use two windows

When authoring your portfolio review, set up two Notion windows side-by-side.

This will make it easier to link to evidence already within your portfolio.
