## Reviewing the example post

The purpose of your portfolio is to share evidence of understanding of our [[Learning Goals|course learning goals]]. Please [review the course outline](https://bit.ly/lcscs23-g11-sco) for a refresher on how you are assessed and evaluated in this course, if needed.

Click on the example post provided:

### Sharing progress

In the **Progress** section, show what you have done since your last post.

A few sentences might be enough sometimes, but the more you expand on what you accomplished, the better the evidence of your understanding tends to be.

Note how the author of this example post included at least one screenshot to support what they described accomplishing:

Be sure to tag Mr. Gordon using `@Russell Gordon`. He will then reply and answer your questions prior to the start of our next class.

You will get individualized written feedback!

If you have no questions, please indicate that, so Mr. Gordon knows you did not miss filling in this section.

> It may take a moment for the body of the new post to load.

It's a good idea to write a descriptive title for your post. That makes it easier to find information as your portfolio grows.

Describing the current day of the course, and the topic of the post, is one approach.

For example: "Thread 1, Day 1: Drawing my name":

Go ahead and write within the sections provied.

You can add new "blocks" or places to provide information as needed.
