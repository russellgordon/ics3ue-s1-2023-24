## A conversation

When we engage in a back and forth about your learning, even when that occurs in writing on a portfolio post, that is a conversation.

Conversations reveal understanding, and are a valuable form of evidence.

## Triangulation

When we have portfolio review conversations, one of the questions I'll often ask you is – what have you learned? How did you learn that?

You can use comments on your posts to help answer that question.

Ultimately, conversations are one of the three major pillars used to determine your grade in this course.

## What not to do

When you see a post in Notion, you will notice a checkmark icon above a comment:

Please don't press that button – it resolves a comment – which hides it.

Comments *can* be un-resolved, but that takes extra clicks, and as mentioned above – it's much easier for you to show growth if you can demonstrate in a portfolio review that you've acted upon the feedback received by others (your teacher and peers).
